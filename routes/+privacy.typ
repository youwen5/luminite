We do not collect your data, except for web vitals and analytics provided by
#link("https://www.simpleanalytics.com/")[Simple Analytics]. Only minimal and
anonymous data about your visit is recorded.

We do not respect the #link("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track")[Do
  Not Track] signal, and frankly you shouldn't be using it anyways because it
makes you easier to fingerprint (which presumably is counter-productive). If
analytics bother you, disable JavaScript. The site is fully usable without it.
