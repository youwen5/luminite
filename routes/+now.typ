This is my #link("https://nownownow.com/about")[now page]. It's supposed to be
an answer to "what have you been up to lately"?

= Coordinates

I'm studying at #link("https://www.ucsb.edu/")[#smallcaps[ucsb]] for the foreseeable future.

= Thinking, doing, and done

- Recently I decided to switch to pure math, from applied math. Not for any particularly strong reason, but the classes in pure math were mostly ones I wanted to take anyways, so why not.
- In a somewhat dissonant move I also picked up a double major in computer science, mainly to study #smallcaps[programming languages] and #smallcaps[cryptology], among other things.
- I've also been thinking of picking up a minor in Philosophy, and in particular
  the philosophy of labor and our relationship with work.

= Games

- Lately I've been playing/replaying #link("https://discoelysium.com/")[Disco Elysium].
