This is my #link("https://nownownow.com/about")[now page]. It's supposed to be
a public answer to "what have you been up to lately"?

= Whereabouts

I'm studying at #link("https://www.ucsb.edu/")[#smallcaps[ucsb]] for the foreseeable future.

= Done and still doing

- Recently I decided to switch to pure math, from applied math. I think the coding and numerical methods in applied math are not particularly interesting, especially compared to the abstraction of pure math.
- In a somewhat dissonant move I also picked up a double major in computer science, mainly to study #smallcaps[programming languages] and #smallcaps[formal verification], among other things.

= Future

- I'm thinking of starting a project called "How #smallcaps[posix] can you get in 31 days?" where I try to write as much of a #smallcaps[posix] compliant operating system as possible, from scratch, with a 1 month time limit. Probably using Rust or Zig. I'm fleshing the idea out right now.

= Fun

- Lately I've been playing/replaying #link("https://discoelysium.com/")[Disco Elysium].
- In lieu of Monster Hunter Wilds (which is impossible to run without a supercomputer), I've been playing Monster Hunter World and Iceborne instead.

= Prose

Some stuff I've been reading lately.
