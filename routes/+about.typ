= History

I study at UC Santa Barbara and spend most of my productive time doing math or
programming. I#(apostrophe)m originally from Shanghai, China. I lived in the
state of Utah for a few years as a kid, before moving to the San Francisco Bay Area.

= Computing

I seek to create more _reliable_ and _resilient_ systems. To that end I
contribute to various open source projects that aim to increase reproducibility
and determinism in software systems at scale.

I run a purely functional (in the true mathematical sense) computing
environment that enables the deterministic deployment of software,
configuration, and infrastructure all the way down the stack. This includes
both the system itself, which can never mutate state and must be rebuilt for
modifications to be made, as well as a purely functional userspace, that keeps
programs configured precisely as described and managed transactionally. My text
editor is configured in a Lisp called Fennel and deployed in a purely
functional fashion by Nix.

Additionally, I prefer to work on and with software that respects my freedom.
In fact my M1 Macbook Pro runs an entirely free reverse engineered graphics and
driver stack. All of my computers run a free GNU/Linux operating system.

Key benefits of my approach to computing include:

- fearless hacking: as the system is rebuilt each time it is modified, it can
  simply transactionally rollback to a previous system generation.

- text-based and keyboard driven: by keeping the system entirely deterministic (not just
  technically, but philosophically), I can ditch unwieldy graphical interfaces
  and build a text-centered user experience.
- trustless full source bootstrap:
  secure yourself from malevolent state actors and resist the KTH by
  bootstrapping the entire system from its free source code and a minimal amount
  of binary seeds.

please help me man i can#(apostrophe)t even do an integral anymore all i know is abstraction
